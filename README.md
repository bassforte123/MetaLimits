# MetaLimits
An Enter the Gungeon mod that provides optional permanent perks for completing various milestones.  
Accessed through the Options menu under MOD CONFIG.  Locked perks are in grey and describe what's needed to unlock them.  Restart Enter the Gungeon to update your menu and make any newly unlocked perks available.  Colored perk titles and descriptions mean that they are at the highest perk level while perks with colored titles and white descriptions have higher levels available.  All perks come with a Vanilla option to turn them off if desired.

This mod is not designed to work with the similar Pushing the Limits mod but they can likely work together if you're not using conflicting option selections.
